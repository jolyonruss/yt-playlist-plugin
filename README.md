yt-playlist-plugin
==================

A browser plugin that consolidates all instances of YouTube that are open and creates a playlist and saves it to your YouTube account.

The current build is based off an Extentionizr boilerplate with the following parameters

http://extensionizr.com/!#{"modules":["browser-mode","with-bg","with-persistent-bg","no-options","no-override","inject-js","jquerymin"],"boolean_perms":["tabs"],"match_ptrns":["http://youtube.com"]}


OK, so we're getting a list of youtube tabs.




Before we get caught up in OAuth, lets just embed them all in one long column





============================================

It looks like hooking up the OAuth youtube API stuff might be a little trickier

Refused to load the script 'https://apis.google.com/js/client.js' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "script-src 'self' chrome-extension-resource:".
